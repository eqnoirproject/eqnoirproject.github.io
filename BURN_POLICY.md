# 🔥 EQNOIR Token Burn Policy

EQNOIR is a utility token built to support financial empowerment and decentralized wealth for Black and LGBTQIA+ communities. Our approach to token burns is responsible, transparent, and community-first.

## ✅ What Is a Token Burn?
Burning means permanently removing tokens from circulation by sending them to an irretrievable address (`0x000...dEaD`). This reduces supply, potentially increasing token scarcity and value.

## 🔒 Legal and Ethical Standards
EQNOIR only burns tokens that are:
- Reserved for this purpose (e.g., burn reserves)
- Held by the core team or in designated wallets
- Approved by DAO vote or community roadmap

EQNOIR will never use burns to manipulate price or mislead the public.

## 🔄 Burn Strategy
- **First Burn (Q2 2025)**: 0.0001% of total supply (~4T EQNOIR)
- **Future Burns**: Based on DAO votes, milestones, or reserve downsizing
- **Transparency**: All burns are publicly viewable via BscScan and tracked on our website
